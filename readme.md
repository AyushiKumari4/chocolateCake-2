# **About Cake**

*If you have ever seen the movie Matilda you will surely remember the scene where the boy is forced to eat the most delicious looking chocolate cake ever. I feel just like that boy when I eat this cake. It is my Matilda chocolate cake for sure. This cake is moist and has the perfect crumb. I cannot imagine making a chocolate cake using any other recipe.*

*The Most Amazing Chocolate Cake is here. I call this my Matilda Cake because I swear it's just as good as the cake that Bruce Bog trotter ate in Matilda. Moist, chocolaty perfection. This is the chocolate cake you've been dreaming of.*
